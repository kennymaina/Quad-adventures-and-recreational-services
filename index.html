  <h2>HIKING ACTIVITIES</h2>
    <ol>
      <h3>BUNGEE JUMPING</h3>
      <img src="images/v.jpg" alt="Bungee picture">
      <p> It is an activity that involves jumping from a tall structure while connected to a large elastic cord. The tall structure is usually a fixed object, such as a building, bridge or crane; but it is also possible to jump from a movable object, such as a hot-air-balloon or helicopter, that has the ability to hover above the ground. The thrill comes from the free-falling and the rebound <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungee_jumping">Bungee_jumping</a></p>
       <h3>PHOTOGRAPHY</h3>
       <img src="images/d.jpg" alt="picture">
       <p>Photography and hiking go together like... well,
         like just about any cliche you can think up. There's just so much out there to see. Bringing photographs back is a way to share that beauty with others, or prompt your own memories of the places
         you've been.
         Just one warning: Don't get so carried away with your photographs that you forget to drink in the natural beauty
         with your own eyes, too.</p>
         <h3>SCRAMBLING AND CLIMBING</h3>
         <img src="images/e.jpg" alt="picture">
         <p>From a hiker's perspective, many of us will enjoy a good scramble just as much as any climber -- heck, some of us are climbers, too! But if you're venturing onto technical terrain (where you really need a rope or specialized skills to be safe), make sure you and everyone else in the party understand the risks and have the right ​skill set for managing them!

         Even mild exposure merits respect and caution.
         But with that said, a good scramble or climb -- when tackled knowingly -- is a ton of fun!</p>
         <h3>SIT AND WATCH</h3>
         <img src="images/s.jpg" alt="picture">
         <p>"Getting somewhere" is one of the biggest reasons we hike, right? But sometimes just getting outside -- and really being there -- is enough of a destination.
         Try this and see what you think: Instead of hiking to a specific place,
         just hit your favorite trail and find a place -- preferably off the trail -- to sit and watch. You might be amazed by just
         how much nature goes quiet when you pass by, and how much of it comes spilling back in if you take the time to sit, watch, and listen.</p>
        <h3>LEARNING</h3>
        <img src="images/lea.jpg" alt="picture">
        <p>You can learn a lot from books -- but We're firmly of the mind that there's no better school for real hands-on learning than the outdoors. Outdoor centers, science centers, municipal recreation programs and park facilities are usually rife with learning opportunities.
        Pair hiking with education on outings that teach basic foraging and tracking skills, on birding walks to identify or survey local birds, or on outings that focus on the life-cycle of one specific animal.
        If no local groups offer such outings, you can DIY with the help of a good guidebook and a little common sense.</p>
<h2>TEAM BUILDING</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.ventureteambuilding.co.uk/tent-build/">Blindfold Tent Build</a> </h3>
Blindfolded and under pressure, the group have to work together in a race against the clock to put up a tent. Blindfold tent build is a great challenge for developing communication and leadership skills.

<h3>Campfire Stories</h3>
A classic activity that inspires storytelling and improves team bonding. Teams gather in a circle and share their workplace experiences. Along the way, they learn things about each other and relive old memories.</h3>
<h3>Memory Wall</h3>
A physical activity that establishes and re-lives the team’s shared memories. Teams sketch their shared memories with each other and place them on a wall. The wall remains up throughout the event, working as a focal point of the team’s camaraderie.</h3>
<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
A simple but meaningful activity that sets the tone for an event and builds consensus on shared values. Teams list what matters to them on a whiteboard. Perfect for the start of an event or workshop.

<h3><a href="http://www.ventureteambuilding.co.uk/hold-up-papers-team-building-activity/">Holdup Papers</a></h3>

This team building activity challenges participants to be creative in solving a simple problem: how many sheets of paper can two people hold up? The catch: the papers should be held up (somehow, creatively!) between their bodies.
